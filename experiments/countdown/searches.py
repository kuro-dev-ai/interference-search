"""Search strategies compared in the Countdown ablations. All take the same judge and the same cost unit:
one expansion = the judge looks at one state and the environment executes all of its moves.

  linear            one chain at a time: sample the next state by the judge's score, restart on failure
  frontier          level-synchronous frontier over merged states, width = budget / depth
  frontier_nomerge  the same, but duplicate states are kept and occupy slots
  bestfirst         strictly sequential, a ranked memory of every state seen, always continue from the best
